          Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
          Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who
          seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage,
          the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts â€“ the first
          set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The
          series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995),
          which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop
          Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

          A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf
          village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries
          in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth
          Hokage, Minato Namikaze seals the fox inside the body of his newborn
          son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the beast;[i] this costs
          Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement
          to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by
          Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a
          decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events,
          Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when
          Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then
          defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka
          Umino.
